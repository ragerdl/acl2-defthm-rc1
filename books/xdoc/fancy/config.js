// XDOC Configuration
//
// Most users should not edit this file.
//
// You only need to change this if you are going to load your data on the fly
// via ajax queries and xdataget.pl.  In this case, you need to:
//
//   (1) Build the sqlite database using xdata2sql.pl
//   (2) Install xdata.db and xdataget.pl somewhere on your web server
//   (3) Point this at your xdataget.pl script.
//
// Example Syntax:
// var XDATAGET = "http://my-server/cgi-bin/my-manual/xdataget.pl";

var XDATAGET = "";
