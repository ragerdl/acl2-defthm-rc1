  :long "<p>ACL2 includes a built-in function named @('extend-pathname') that
is similar to @('catpath').  In some ways ACL2's version is nicer than
@('catpath').  It sometimes cleans up the path and gets rid of @('..')
characters.  But it also sometimes expands away symlinks, which you may not
want to do.  At the time of this writing, @('extend-pathname') is not easy to
effectively bring into logic mode, but that may change in the future.</p>

<p>Our @('catpath') function is comparatively primitive.  It doesn't try to
simplify the path in any way.</p>

<p>We assume Unix style paths, i.e., @('/') is the path separator.  It's not
clear what we should do to support other systems like Windows.</p>"
