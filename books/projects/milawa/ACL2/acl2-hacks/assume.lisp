(defdoc assume
  ":Doc-Section Events

   a system for sharing assumptions across many theorems~/

   We provide a simple table-based system for reusable assumptions.  To the
   user, this system takes on the following interface:
   ~bv[]
     (assume <term>)
        adds term to the local assumptions

     (unassume <term>)
        removes <term> from the local assumptions

     (conclude <name> <thm> :hints ... :rule-classes ...)
        like defth, but proves <thm> under the current assumptions
   ~ev[]

   For example, consider the following ACL2 rules:
   ~bv[]
     (defthm natp-of-plus
       (implies (and (natp x)
                     (natp y))
                (natp (+ x y))))

     (defthm natp-of-minus
       (implies (and (natp x)
                     (natp y)
                     (< y x))
                (natp (- x y))))
   ~ev[]

   We can convert these into the assume/conclude style as follows:
   ~ev[]
     (assume (natp x))
     (assume (natp y))
     (conclude natp-of-plus (natp (+ x y)))
     (conclude natp-of-minus (implies (< y x) (natp (- x y))))
   ~ev[]~/

   The ~c[assume] and ~c[unassume] commands are implicitly ~il[local], so you
   can use ~il[encapsulate] in addition to ~c[unassume] to limit the scope of
   your assumptions.

   The ~c[conclude] command recognizes ~c[thm]s of the following forms:
   ~bv[]
      (implies (and hyp1 ... hypN) concl)
      (implies hyp1 concl)
      concl
   ~ev[]

   It augments the <thm> by injecting the current assumptions after the last
   hyp.  That is, we produce:
   ~bv[]
     (implies (and hyp1 ... hypN assm1 ... assmK) concl)
     (implies (and hyp1 assm1 ... assmK) concl)
     (implies (and assm1 ... assmK) concl)
   ~ev[]

   We expect this to be appropriate most of the time, since shared hyps tend to
   be ``common'' sorts of things, e.g., type constraints, etc.  Meanwhile, the
   unshared hyps should tend to be more complicated and unusual, so we place
   them at the front of the rule in an effort to make ``fast failing'' rules.")
