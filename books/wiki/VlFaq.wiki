Questions

  * What's a "single identifier" in an always block, as in the following fatal warning?

     {{{Expected all left-hand sides to be single identifiers, but found q[6:0] <= d[6:0];}}}

  The indexes into {{{q}}} and {{{d}}} are throwing off VL.  That can be fixed by making your assignment from q to d, as in:

    {{{q <= d}}}
