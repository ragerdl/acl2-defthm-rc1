Way for us to track the current status of the books.  I need an analog of unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features for the repositories.  Time will tell whether it stays updated.

Status of ACL2(hp):
  * Regression suite certifies using ACL2(hp) with customization file acl2_sources/acl2-customization-files/parallel-resource-based.lisp.
  * Some books are skipped because they are incompatible with waterfall paralellism
  * See issue 36 for more info https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=36

Status of other things worth noting:
  * Nothing written yet
