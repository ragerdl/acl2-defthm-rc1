=Convention for Relocating Books=

  * `svn cp` the old books to the new location
  * Replace the content of the old book with the following:

{{{
(in-package "ACL2")
;; The following line marks this book as a relocation stub:
;; cert_param: (reloc_stub)
(include-book "new/location/of/this/book" :dir :system)
}}}

  * Build the regression suite and update the files flagged as including the old version to use the new version.  Keyboard macros and `svn diff` are your friend.

  * After the stubs (generated in the second step) have been in a minor release of ACL2 (e.g., going from ACL2 6.1 to 6.2), remove them from the repository.
