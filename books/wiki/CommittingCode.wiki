#summary Suggested guidelines for anyone who wants to commit code.

= Important guidelines =

  * Document what you have changed when you commit.
  * Avoid breaking the build, by running a full regression including the workshop books.
  * Make sure all parens are balanced.  File emacs/emacs-acl2.el distributed with ACL2 defines a command meta-x find-unbalanced-parentheses for this purpose.
  * Books should target the latest official ACL2 release, even if that is an incremental release x.y.z.
  * Either use the standard makefile approch (see :doc book-makefiles) or explain why this would be awkward.  Non-standard makefiles should still cause the string "**CERTIFICATION FAILED**" to be printed whenever a book's certification fails.
  * Avoid non-local in-theory events except when there is a good reason for them.
  * If you add a new top-level directory, be sure to record any new directory-level dependencies in books/Makefile.
  * Comment all non-trivial changes with your name.
