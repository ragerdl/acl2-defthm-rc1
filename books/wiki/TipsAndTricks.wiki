#summary Tips and Tricks for Navigating ACL2 Library Code

= Introduction =

A place for short FAQs related to the ACL2 books with quick answers

== How do I figure out which versions affect a particular symbol? ==

A quick way of answering this question is to issue

{{{
svn diff -r 2000:2053 | grep firstn-chars
}}}

There are more complicated methods, but they're more work.  For more information, see http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=86


== How can I determine which books are currently being certified? ==

The following command can provide that information on some Linux systems.  (There are probably suitable such options for "ps" on most any such system, including MacOS.)

{{{
ps axww
}}}
