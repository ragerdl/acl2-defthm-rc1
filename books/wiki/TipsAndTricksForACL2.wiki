#summary Tips and Tricks for using ACL2

= Introduction =

Random "gotchas" that Rager has discovered while using ACL2 at an intermediate level.  These could be folded into the ACL2 documentation topics TIPS or TIDBITS at some point, but I'm just writing them here for now.

= Gotchas =

  * :use hints only add the instance of the theorem being used to the hypotheses of the subgoal you're trying to prove.  They do not tell the prover to actually use to substitute the LHS of the instantiation for the RHS (provided its an equals relation).  The hypothesis will only help rewrite the conclusion of the subgoal if the RHS of the instantiated theorem (what becomes the additional hypothesis) is "less complex" (determined via some implementation-specific heuristics) than the LHS.

  A potential work-around is to write a rewrite-rule that is basically the instantiation of the lemma you want, but due to the theorem prover only using rewrite-rules in a relatively strict manner (compared to if the instantiation was part of the hypotheses, where it can be used in the context of the conclusion, etc.).

  * When writing rewrite rules that use arithmetic (e.g., using +), you probably want your arguments to arithmetic "functions" (like +) to match the term order of the checkpoints that you're seeing.  It's unlikely that you will see a checkpoint like the following (where _a_, _b_, and _c_ represent terms themselves where the correct "term order" (see :DOC topic _term order_) indicates that _a_ < _b_ < _c_):

  (equal (+ _c_ _b_ _a_) ...)

  Presuming associativity-of-+ and commutativity-of-+ are enabled (which they typically are), it's more likely you will see this checkpoint:

  (equal (+ _a_ _b_ _c_) ...)

  This is because ACL2 (even with most any arithmetic libraries) tends to canonicalize the order of arguments to arithmetic "functions" (like +).  So, unless you disable associativity-of-+ and commutativity-of-+, any checkpoint you're likely to see will probably present the arithmetic term that ACL2 is "stuck on" in term order.  Thus, you should write your rewrite rules with the term order of the arithmetic expressions that you're likely to see in checkpoints in mind.

  Here is some further paraphrased discussion from Davis on the matter:

  It doesn't really make sense to worry about term-order when writing the LHS of a rule.  The term-order matters in the subgoal and you have to have general enough rules to match whatever order you happen to encounter.   There isn't a "correct" way to write your rewrite rule that will solve the general problem.  It's the term order of the terms you're *matching* that matters, and you generally don't have any control over that when you're writing the rule.
