#summary Books added after the release of ACL2 Version 3.4, together with partial discussion of changes other than additions.

= Introduction =

The following list of books and directories describes changes
since the release of ACL2 Version 3.4.

Other changes since Version 3.4: (1) Files that are not to be
certified and had .lisp suffixes now generally have .lsp suffixes; and
(2) Many cert.lsp and certify.lsp files have been removed.

= List of Books =

add-ons/hash-stobjs.lisp:
   Experimental book which allows stobjs to contain hash table members.
   Requires a trust tag since it redefines ACL2 system functions.

arithmetic-5/:
   Replacement for (and improvement on) arithmetic-4/.

clause-processors/decomp-hint.lisp:

   Introduces computed hints useful for proving local properties of a
   cons tree by systematically structurally decomposing it.

clause-processors/equality.lisp:
   NOT NEW, but no longer requires a ttag to use.

clause-processors/generalize.lisp:
   Provides a generalization clause processor.

clause-processors/join-thms.lisp:
   Contains a macro which introduces rules about an evaluator and
   conjoin and disjoin; useful for verifying clause processors.

clause-processors/generalize.lisp:
   Defines a verified clause processor which replaces certain terms
   with fresh variables.  Also contains useful functions for creating
   fresh variables.

clause-processors/multi-env-trick.lisp:
   Introduces a trick that can be useful for proving clause processors
   correct when the variables in the clauses produced have complicated
   binding relationships with the original clause.

clause-processors/null-fail-hints.lisp:
   Introduces keyword hints :null, which does nothing, and :fail,
   which causes the proof to fail.  These are probably not as good as
   :no-op and :error, which are built into ACL2.

clause-processors/replace-defined-consts.lisp:
   Introduces a computed hint that replaces defined constants (see
   tools/defined-const.lisp) with their definitions.

clause-processors/replace-impl.lisp:
   Introduces a clause processor that replaces a hyp with something
   implied by that hyp.

clause-processors/use-by-hint.lisp:
   Introduces a computed hint to apply a particular :by hint as
   signalled by a logically meaningless hyp placed in the clause, so
   that a clause processor can produce clauses that are copies of
   statements of existing theorems.

defsort/:
   Defines a stable sort when given a comparison function.

hacking/evalable-ld-printing.lisp:
   Print LD results in "evalable" way.

hons-archive/:
   Implements Hons Archives (HARs), which are a way to write ACL2
   objects to disk so they can be loaded in other ACL2 sessions.

make-event/ REMOVALS:
   embedded-defaxioms/, embedded-defaxioms.{acl2,lisp}

make-event/defmac.lisp:
   Alternative to defmacro that can be more efficient for macro expansion.

make-event/make-redundant.lisp:
   Defines a simple make-event which submits a redundant copy of a
   defthm/defun/defmacro event.  The practical use of this is for
   cases where in a book or encapsulate context, an encapsulate
   exports some events that should be book-local and some that should
   not.

make-event/require-book.lisp:
   Provides a way of specifying that a book should be included when
   using a book but is not needed for certification.

misc/evalable-printing.lisp:
   Implements a "beginner-friendly" way of printing objects such that
   evaluating the printed result gives that same result.  See also
   ../hacking/evalable-ld-printing.lisp, which prints LD results in
   "evalable" way, as provided by "evalable-printing" book.

misc/fast-coerce.lisp:
   A replacement for coerce, which speeds up (coerce x 'list).

misc/invariants.lisp:
   Tries to prove lemmas stating that if a certain property is true of
   the arguments to a function, that property will be true of the
   arguments to all its recursive calls.

misc/simplify-thm.lisp:
   A simple event generator which breaks a term thought to be a theorem
   into some number of theorems of a form where none of the hyps nor
   the conclusion contain IFs.  Someone may wish to extend this with
   rule-classes and other more flexible options.

misc/trace1.lisp:
   Alternate implementation of tracing.

misc/trace-star.lisp:
   A beginner-friendly variant of trace$.  Features "evalable"
   printing, provided by "evalable-printing" book, and other
   modifications.

regex/:
   An ACL2 regular expression library aiming for feature parity with
   grep.

rtl/rel8/:
   Replacement for (and probably improvement on) rtl/rel7/.

security/:
   Provides a place to store work related to security protocol 
   verification.

security/jfkr:
   A model for key-establishment security protocol JFKr.  Also contains
   a cryptography library that models "perfect cryptography" and a
   Diffie-Helman implementation.

tools/defined-const:
   Utility which, when using the HONS system, can define a constant to
   be the result of some expensive computation and prove a theorem that
   the constant equals the original term, while only running the
   computation once.  Requires running the computation twice if not
   using the HONS system.  Also see
   clause-processors/replace-defined-consts.lisp.

tools/flag.lisp:
   Make-event that defines a "flag function" that provides an
   induction scheme appropriate for use with a mutually-recursive
   clique, and also defines a macro useful for proving theorems about
   functions in the clique.

tools/mv-nth.lisp:
   Provides a :meta rule to open MV-NTH occurrences, and disables
   MV-NTH so that you see (MV-NTH 0 ...) rather than (CAR ...).

tools/rulesets.lisp:
   Provides tools for defining and modifying rulesets, which are
   similar in spirit to defined theories but can be modified once
   defined.

tools/safe-case.lisp:
   A drop-in replacement for case, and is logically identical to case.
   The only difference is during execution.  When case is used and
   none of the cases match, the answer is nil.  But when safe-case is
   used and none of the cases match, the result is an error.

tools/saved-errors.lisp
   Provides a mechanism for running a series of generated events and
   printing a useful error message when one of them fails.

tools/stobj-help.lisp:
   Provides a make-event which proves some useful rules about a stobj,
   such as type theorems, access/update rewrite rules, etc.

tools/with-arith5-help:
   Utility which locally loads the arithmetic-5 books, but disables the
   rules it introduces. Provides macros which can enable these rules
   when they are needed.

unicode/:
   Added books prefixp.lisp, read-file-objects.lisp, and rev.lisp, and
   removed books utf8-decode-string.lisp and utf8.lisp.
