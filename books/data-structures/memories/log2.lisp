; log2.lisp - implementation of log base 2 function
;
; This is an implementation file and should not be directly included in
; external work.  Use the interface file (memtree.lisp) instead!
;
; Unfortunately, ACL2 doesn't have a built in base-2 log function, so we need
; to write our own.  There are far more efficient implementations than this
; simple definition available, but I think that this is nice as far as
; reasoning goes and one should realize that for our purposes, log2 will rarely
; be called (only when new memories are being created), so the inefficiency
; here is unlikely to pose a problem.
