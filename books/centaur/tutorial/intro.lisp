;                  Centaur Hardware Verification Tutorial
;
; This tutorial walks through the verification of some very simple hardware
; designs using the Centaur books.  These hardware designs are all contrived
; and are far simpler than real hardware.  But this makes them easy to
; understand and verify.
;
; The general flow is:
;
;  - We introduce a few (toy) hardware designs as Verilog modules.
;
;  - We use the VL library to translate these Verilog designs into the E
;    hardware description language.
;
;  - We write some STVs (symbolic test vectors) for the ESIM symbolic
;    simulator.  These test vectors capture certain sets of executions of the
;    modules.
;
;  - We use the GL framework to prove that these executions always satisfy
;    certain correctness properties.
;
; We also make some false conjectures to illustrate debugging features, e.g.,
; dumping out waveforms.
;
;
; NOTE: Before you begin, we assume you have followed the instructions in
; centaur/books/README.html and gotten the Centaur books built!



; intro.lisp
;
; This book just contains a necessary base set of books for using VL, ESIM, and
; GL all together.  Our other tutorial books will include intro.lisp as a
; starting point.

; BOZO probably work on making these includes more coherent.

(set-waterfall-parallelism nil) ; for below call of def-gl-clause-processor

; This is critical.  It introduces a GL clause processor that can natively
; execute at least the functions from the above books that get marked with
; add-clause-proc-exec-fns:
