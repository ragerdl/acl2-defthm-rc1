; This is a horrible hack for disconnecting and reconnecting shared libraries
; from CCL.
;
; Goal: prevent your "released" application from depending on temporary files
; in your working area, which you might clobber after the release.
;
; Mechanism:
;
;  1. Disconnect-shared-libs tells CCL to unload any shared libraries that it
;     has loaded from absolute paths.  It simultaneously copies these shared
;     libraries into your current location.
;
;  2. Use save-exec to build your application.
;
;  3. Move the resulting image and all of the copies of the .so files into
;     the "final" release area where your application will permanently live
;
;  4. Edit your application's startup files so that they start with:
;        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/app/release:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
;
;  5. At startup time, your application should (as its first task) call
;     reconnect-shared-libs, to reload the shared libraries.  If all is well,
;     it will load the libraries from its own release area, instead of from
;     wherever you were loading them from when you were developing the program.
;
; If anyone knows how to do this better, we would very much like to print this
; code out, mush it up, and throw it in a fire.  So please let us know.
