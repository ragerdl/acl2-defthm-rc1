(in-package "ACL2")


;; Defines a function that swaps the contents of two (congruent) stobjs.
;; Logically, just return one and the other.

;; Defines a function called swap-stobj1.  Stobj2 should be another stobj
;; declared congruent to stobj1.

;; Implementation note: ACL2 sometimes assumes that the stobj returned by a
;; form is the same object (i.e. pointer) as the corresponding stobj that was
;; input to that form.  E.g., stobj-let has an optimization that assumes stobj
;; fields that are updated do not actually need to be reinstalled in the stobj
;; that they came from -- it'll just be the same pointer, so reinstalling them
;; would be no-ops.  This has the consequence that we can't just do (in the raw
;; Lisp executable version of our swap) what we say we're doing in the non-exec
;; version, namely, return the pointers, just swapped.
