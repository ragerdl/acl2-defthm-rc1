  :short "Elimination of @('supply0') and @('supply1') wires"

  :long "<p>In this transformation, we throw away declarations like @('supply0
a') and @('supply1 b'), and replace occurrences of @('a') and @('b') throughout
expressions with @('0') and @('1'), respectively.</p>

<p><b>BOZO.</b> This transformation is sort of okay, but we should come up with
something better.  As it turns out, something as simple as eliminating supplies
actually has some subtleties.</p>

<p>A deficiency of our current approach is: what if someone tries to assign to
a supply?  At best, they'll get some kind of message that says they're trying
to assign to a constant, which won't be very informative.  Our approach also
completely throws away the overwhelming strength of a supply, in case we ever
want to try to do anything with that.</p>

<p>We do not throw out any supply0 or supply1 wires which are also inputs or
outputs to the module.  Instead, we convert them into regular wires!  This is
crazy.  What are the semantics of an input that is a supply?  What if someone
hooks up something that isn't supply-like to it?</p>

<p>We annotate inputs that we convert in this way with the property VL_SUPPLY_0
or VL_SUPPLY_1, so that some day we might do the most basic kind of checks that
you haven't hooked up a bad wire to a supply, and so that the verification
person may at least see that this input is supposed to have a particular
value.</p>")
