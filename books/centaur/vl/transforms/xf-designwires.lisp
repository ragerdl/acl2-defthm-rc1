<li>wires that VL added in transforms like @(see split) and @(see occform).</li>

<p>This transform should typically be run very early.  It just annotates every
net and reg declaration with a @('VL_DESIGN_WIRE') <see topic='@(url

<p>When temporary wires are added to the module by subsequent VL transforms,
they will not have this attribute.  Hence, you can check for this attribute to
tell whether a wire was in the original design.</p>")
