but which have not yet been released for whatever reason.  When it comes time
for us to run our transforms, we just defattach our implementations to these
hooks.  For non-Centaur users, these steps are just no-ops.</p>

<p>Some of these transforms will never be released because they're gross hacks
that are intended to address Centaur-specific things, and they wouldn't be of
any interest outside of Centaur.  We may release the others eventually, but
they may be in beta or tied into other libraries in a deep way that makes it
hard to make them available at this time.</p>")
