<p>Even though our parser essentially establishes that the files we have just
read are syntactically well-formed, this does not necessarily mean the files
are semantically well-formed.  For instance, a module might illegally declare
the same wire twice, or perhaps we have tried to declare two modules with the
same name.  So, our reasonableness check is important for ensuring the basic
semantic correctness of the modules we are examining.</p>

<p>We also regard many perfectly valid Verilog constructs as unreasonable, for
the simple pragmatic reason that we are only really interested in dealing with
the small subset of Verilog that we actually encounter at Centaur.  There is
little motivation for us to support things like complicated port lists merely
because they are in the Verilog-2005 standard.</p>")

; Always blocks are quite hard to handle because of how complex they are.  But
; we try to support a very limited subset of them.
;
; In particular, below we sketch out an extremely restrictive set of
; "reasonable statements" which include only nonblocking assignments guarded by
; if statements, and statement blocks.  This is not quite sufficient.  We also
; need to be able to look at sensitivity lists.  It turns out that in Verilog
; code such as:
;
;   always @ (posedge clk) foo ;
;
; This sensitivity list is actually part of a statement and is not part of the
; "always" itself.  These are called Procedural Timing Control Statements, and
; in our parse tree occur as vl-ptctrlstmt-p's.
;
; We do not try to support these in any general way, and prohibit them from
; occurring in "reasonable statements".  However, our always-block recognizer
; permits a single one of these to occur at the top level, as long as it meets
; a list of requirements.
