;                            PARSING DELAYS
;
; See Section 7.14 for the rules for computing delays.  Three delay expressions
; are associated with each gate: a rise delay, fall delay, and a high-impedence
; (or charge decay, for triregs) delay.  When three delays are specified, there
; is no confusion and everything is explicit.
;
; When only two delays are given, the first is the rise delay, the second is
; the fall delay.  For regular gates, the high impedence delay is supposed to
; be the "lesser" of these.  But it is not clear just what that means or how to
; compute it, because these may be compound mintypmax expressions.  That is,
; which is lesser, 1:2:5 or 1:3:4?  Also, the expression can mention variables,
; so the parser itself isn't going to be able to figure out the high impetence
; delay in all cases.  The rules are different for computing the charge decay
; delay for triregs, and we do not try to implement them, either.
;
; When only one delay is given, all three delays are set to it.
;
; When no delay is given, all three are treated as zero.

; dive into the token and check that its etext does not contain #\', since
; that's the character that starts every base.  Maybe we should just be more
; flexible than the spec says, instead.
