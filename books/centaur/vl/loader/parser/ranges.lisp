; Dimensions and ranges are introduced with the following rules.
;
; dimension ::= '[' dimension_constant_expression ':' dimension_constant_expression ']'
;
; range ::= '[' msb_constant_expression ':' lsb_constant_expression ']'
;
; But these are all just aliases to constant_expression, which we treat as
; regular expressions.  Note also that the names above in "range" are
; misleading, since no particular order is required.  Moreover, we do not make
; any distinction between dimensions and ranges.  That is, in either case, we
; call vl-parse-range and produce vl-range-p objects.
