  :parents (exploding-vectors)
  :short "Associates wire names (strings) to lists of @(see vl-emodwire-p)s
which represent the wire's bits in <b>msb-first order</b>."

  :long "<p>A wire alist provides a bit-level view of the wires in a module by
associating the names of each net and register declared in the Verilog
module (strings) with lists of @(see vl-emodwire-p)s that represent the
individual bits of the wire, in msb-first order.</p>

<p>In particular,</p>

<ul>

<li>Given a range-free Verilog wire named @('w'), we bind the string @('\"w\"')
to @('(ACL2::w)'), i.e., a singleton list with just one symbol; and</li>

<li>Given a Verilog wire, @('w'), with range @('[high:low]'), we bind
@('\"w\"') to @('(ACL2::w[high] ... ACL2::w[low])'), i.e., a list of symbols
from high to low, inclusive.</li>

<li>Given a Verilog wire, @('w'), with range @('[low:high]'), we bind
@('\"w\"') to @('(ACL2::w[low] ... ACL2::w[high])').</li>

</ul>

<p>Our @(see vl-emodwire-p) representation is robust and can reliably deal with
wires no matter what their names.  We can guarantee that the bits produced in a
wire alist are unique as long as the net and register declarations for the
module are uniquely named.</p>

<p>We take special care to avoid generating the names @('T'), @('NIL'), and
@('F'), since these have a special special meaning in Emod; see @(see
vl-plain-wire-name).</p>

<h3>Efficiency Considerations</h3>

<p>Profiling might \"unfairly\" suggest that wire-alist construction is very
expensive.</p>

<p>In particular, the first time we build a wire alist for a module, we are
generally doing \"first-time\" @('intern')s for the names of every bit.  It is
far more expensive to @('intern') a string for the first time than to
subsequently @('intern') it again.  For instance, when we run the following
code in a fresh CCL session, we find that it takes 2.2 seconds to intern
100,000 fresh strings the first time, but it only takes 0.15 seconds to intern
them all again.</p>

@({
 (defpackage \"FOO\" (:use))

 (ccl::egc nil)

 (defparameter *strings*
  (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000
        collect
        (concatenate 'string \"FOO-\"
                     (format nil \"~a\" i))))

 ;; 2.21 seconds, 15 MB allocated
 (time (loop for str in *strings* do (intern str \"FOO\")))

 ;; 0.15 seconds, no allocation
 (time (loop for str in *strings* do (intern str \"FOO\")))
})

<p>When we are interning millions of symbols, the package's size also has a
huge impact on interning performance.  Because of this, we typically build ACL2
with @('ACL2_SIZE=3000000') to avoid very slow interning.</p>

<p>Moreover, whether we intern these symbols \"eagerly\" by constructing a wire
alist or \"lazily\" as they are needed, we will end up doing the same number of
first-time interns.  There is not really any way to avoid this interning
without either fundamentally changing the design of the E language (e.g., to
support vectors), or abandoning named wires in E modules (e.g., using numbers
instead).</p>"

  :long "<p>Typically, for a wire named @('foo'), we generate the symbol
@('ACL2::|foo|').  But there are three special cases.</p>

<p>The symbols @('ACL2::T') and @('ACL2::F') were historically given a special
interpretation by the EMOD hardware simulator, and represented the constant
true and false functions.  These wires no longer have a special meaning in
ESIM, but throughout VL our notion of emodwires still assumes that T and F
stand for constant true and false, and, e.g., we still rely on this in @(see
e-conversion).  We might eventually get away from this by using a transform
analagous to @(see weirdint-elim) to introduce T/F wires and eliminate
constants.</p>

<p>The symbol @('ACL2::NIL') is also special, but for a different and more
fundamental reason: NIL has a special meaning in @(see acl2::patterns), so to
make sure that every @(see vl-emodwire-p) is a good atom in the sense of
patterns, we do not allow NIL to even be an emodwire.</p>

<p>At any rate, if we encounter a Verilog wire named @('T'), @('F'), or
@('NIL'), we must use some other name.  What other name should we use?  We want
to pick something that will not clash with other wire names, but which reflects
the original name of the wire.</p>

<p>We have chosen to use @('T[0]'), @('F[0]'), and @('NIL[0]') as the
replacements.  This should not be too confusing since, e.g., in Verilog
@('T[0]') is typically a valid way to reference a wire named @('T').</p>"

; Name uniqueness check.
;
; Note this uniqueness check is on the module's net and register names and NOT
; on the generated name lists.  This is a performance win since each name might
; expand into lots of bits.  This appears to be taking about 8% of the runtime
; in practice.
;
; I once thought that a fast-alist style check might be better than using
; uniquep.  Here is some code:
;
; (defun no-dupe-netdecls-names (x alist)
;   (declare (xargs :guard (vl-netdecllist-p x)))
;   (if (atom x)
;       (mv t alist)
;     (let ((name1 (vl-netdecl->name (car x))))
;       (if (hons-get name1 alist)
;           (mv nil alist)
;         (let ((alist (hons-acons name1 t alist)))
;           (no-dupe-netdecls-names (cdr x) alist))))))
;
; (defun no-dupe-regdecls-names (x alist)
;   (declare (xargs :guard (vl-regdecllist-p x)))
;   (if (atom x)
;       (mv t alist)
;     (let ((name1 (vl-regdecl->name (car x))))
;       (if (hons-get name1 alist)
;           (mv nil alist)
;         (let ((alist (hons-acons name1 t alist)))
;           (no-dupe-regdecls-names (cdr x) alist))))))
;
; But this was MUCH slower than uniquep in my benchmarks, even when building
; an appropriately-sized alist, even when all of the names were pre-honsed.
;
; BOZO it might be worth looking into how strings are handled in the honsing
; code and revisiting this.  In particular, when we look up a string right now,
; we have to do an EQUAL hash to find its canonical version, even if we're
; staring right at its canonical version.  It might be better to add another EQ
; hash table, say the STR-HT-EQ, that would associate canonical versions of
; strings with themselves.  Then, when checking if a string is honsed, we could
; first look in this EQ hash table, and only look in the EQL hash table if
; there has been a failure.  This would add some space overhead.  It would also
; cost (very slightly) more time when we initially hons strings, and make
; looking up non-honsed strings slightly more expensive.  But it might
; dramatically improve the performance of looking up honsed strings, which
; would give us a nice improvement here.
;
; BOZO this might also be due to fast-alist sentinel problems in previous
; versions of the Hons code, you may wish to revisit it!
