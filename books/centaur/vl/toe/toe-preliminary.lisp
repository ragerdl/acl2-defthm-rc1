  :short "How we convert Verilog modules instances into (preliminary) E module
occurrences."

  :long "<p>This documentation assumes you have already read @(see
e-conversion).  Note that the E occurrences we generate in this initial pass
are only preliminary and might include multiple drivers of certain wires.  See
also @(see exploding-vectors), since we are going to be doing a lot of
that.</p>

<p>To convert each Verilog module instance into preliminary E occurrences, we
need to create E language @(see acl2::patterns) that represent (1) the inputs
and outputs of each module, i.e., the @(':i') and @(':o') patterns for each
module, and (2) the corresponding \"actuals\" of each module instance, i.e.,
the @(':i') and @(':o') patterns for each occurrence.</p>


<h4>Basic Idea</h4>

<p>Suppose we have a module with port declarations like:</p>

@({
input [3:0] a;
input b;
input [5:3] c;

...
})

<p>Then we are going to generate an input pattern like:</p>

@({
:i ( (a[0] a[1] a[2] a[3])
     (b)
     (c[3] c[4] c[5])
     ...)
})

<p>Here, individual bits like @('a[2]') and @('b') are @(see vl-emodwire-p)s.
The bits for each vector form a @(see vl-emodwirelist-p) like @('(a[0] a[1]
a[2] a[3])') or @('(b)').  Finally, our full @(':i') and @(':o') patterns are
lists of such vectors, and are recognized with @(see
vl-emodwirelistlist-p).</p>


<h4>Module I/O Patterns</h4>

<p>Recall the difference between port declarations (see @(see vl-portdecl-p))
and ports (see @(see vl-port-p)).  For instance:</p>

@({
module mymod (.low(vec[3:0]), .high(vec[5:4]), foo)   <-- ports
  input foo;
  input [5:0] vec;   <-- port declarations
endmodule
})

<p>We generate the @(':i') and @(':o') patterns for each module from their port
<i>declarations</i>, not from thir ports; see @(see vl-portdecls-to-i/o) for
details.  Because of this, the actual input pattern for @('mymod') would look
like this:</p>

@({
:i ((foo)
    (vec[0] vec[1] vec[2] vec[3] vec[4] vec[5]))
})


<h4>Port Patterns</h4>

<p>An instance of this mymod might look something like this:</p>

@({
mymod myinstance (a[3:0], b[1:0], c[7]);
})

<p>Unfortunately, the I/O patterns we have generated for @('mymod') are not
very useful when we want to translate @('myinstance'), because its entries are
not at all in the same shape or order as the ports.</p>

<p>To correct for this, we build a <b>port pattern</b> for each module.  For
instance, the port pattern for @('mymod') would be:</p>

@({
 ((vec[3] vec[2] vec[1] vec[0])
  (vec[5] vec[4])
  (foo))
})

<p>The port pattern matches the shape of the module's port expressions, and
lists the wires each port is connected to, in MSB-first order.</p>

<p>Port patterns are generated by @(see vl-portlist-msb-bit-pattern).  We can
carry out certain checking to ensure that the port pattern mentions every input
and output wire without duplication; see @(see port-bit-checking).</p>


<h4>Preliminary E Occurrences</h4>

<p>Port patterns make it pretty easy to create the E occurrence for a module
instance.  In particular, for any valid module instance, we can explode the
\"actuals\" into wires that line up perfectly with the port pattern.  In the
case of @('myinstance'), we sort of intuitively might imagine generating the
following \"actual pattern\":</p>

@({
 ((a[3] a[2] a[1] a[0])
  (b[1] b[0])
  (c[7]))
})

<p>We don't actually build this pattern.  Instead, we directly construct an
alist that binds each formal to its actual; see @(see
vl-modinst-eocc-bindings).</p>

<p>The @(':i') and @(':o') patterns for the module may then be instantiated
with this pattern to form the @(':i') and @(':o') fields for the occurrence.
The main function that does all of this is @(see vl-modinst-to-eocc).</p>")

<p>See @(see vl-emodwirelistlist-p) for some discussion about the kinds of

<p>Historic note.  We originally tried to base our @(':i') and @(':o') patterns
on the order of a module's ports.  We now instead use the order of the port
declarations.  This is particularly nice for ports whose expressions are
concatenations such as @('{foo, bar, baz}'), since the individual components
might not even have the same direction.</p>"
