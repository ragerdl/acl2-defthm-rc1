;; Note: Putting an entry FUNCTION -> DEF-RULE in the  GL::PREFERRED-DEFS table
;; causes MAKE-G-WORLD to assume that DEF-RULE is the name of a :definition
;; rule for FUNCTION and use that definition rule as the definition instead of
;; the original definition of FUNCTION.

;; In this instance, we'd like to change the definition of EVENP used in
;; MAKE-G-WORLD from its original definition, (INTEGERP (* X (/ 2))), to:
;; (or (not (acl2-numberp x))
;;     (and (integerp x)
;;          (equal (logbitp 0 x) nil)))
;;
;; This is better, currently, because the GL system doesn't deal well with
;; rationals at the moment, so (* X 1/2) doesn't work well.  Therefore we prove
;; the rule EVENP-IS-LOGBITP which shows that these are equivalent, and then
;; add the entry to the PREFERRED-DEFS table.

; Below we tweak the definition that GL uses for EXPT so that (EXPT 2 N) is
; treated as a shift instead, where N is a natural number.  This might be a bad
; idea when the base is a variable that is sometimes 2, since it will lead us
; to consider both the ASH and regular EXPT-style definitions.  But it seems
; nice for hardware models where (EXPT 2 N) may be the most frequent use of
; EXPT.

; [Jared]: I ran into performance problems trying to simulate with ACL2's
; ordinary definition of logcount, so this is a faster replacement.
;
; One probably important tweak is to not use NONNEGATIVE-INTEGER-QUOTIENT;
; instead I use ASH to strip off the bits as we recur.  I can imagine that this
; might help quite a bit.
;
; Another problem with ACL2's logical definition of LOGCOUNT is that we end up
; checking whether the number is negative at each recursive step.  This seems
; to get quite expensive.  My replacement definition avoids these checks on the
; recursive steps since we know that once the number has been coerced to a
; natural, it will stay positive as we recur.
