; History.  Jared wrote an initial version of this function for the Unicode
; books.  Sol then extended it with a hack that allows us to prove it
; decreasing without assuming state-p1 in the object case.  (Really it's just a
; workaround for the fact that read-object checks (cdr entry) as a substitute
; for (consp (cdr entry)) to find whether there are objects remaining.

  :long "<p><b>Signature:</b> @(call file-measure) returns a natural
number.</p>

<ul>

<li>@('channel') may be any symbol but is typically an open input channel.</li>

<li>@('state-state') is typically the ACL2 @(see state).</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a @(see logic)-mode function, but its logical definition is tricky;
see @(see logical-story-of-io).  The basic gist is that it returns how many
objects are left in the channel and hence how many functions can still be
read.</p>

<p>This function is only meant to be used to admit functions, and cannot be
executed on the real ACL2 @(see state).</p>"
