(defdoc normed
  ":Doc-Section Hons-and-Memoization

Normed objects are ACL2 Objects that are \"canonical\" or \"unique\" in a
certain sense.~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

In Common Lisp, we can tell whether an ACL2 object is ~st[normed] or not, but
there is no way for an ordinary ACL2 function to see whether an object is
normed.  Hence, whether or not an object is normed is an implementation-level
concept.

The fundamental property of normed objects is that if A and B are both normed,
then ~c[(equal A B)] holds if and only if ~c[(eql A B)] holds.  For strings and
conses, ~c[(eql A B)] holds only when ~c[(eq A B)], so any normed conses or
strings are ~ilc[equal] precisely when they are ~ilc[eq].  The potential
benefits of having normed objects include:  constant-time equality comparisons,
reduced memory usage, fast association lists, and function memoization.

Note that in our implementation, all symbols, characters, and numbers are
automatically normed, and whenever a cons is normed its car and cdr must
also be normed.~/


The Meaning of Normed in Common Lisp.

Recall that the ACL2 Objects are certain \"good\" Common Lisp symbols,
characters, strings, and numbers, and the conses which can be recursively
formed from these good atoms.

Not all properties of these objects are visible in the ACL2 logic.  An example
of an invisible property is the pointer identity of an object.  For example,
suppose we write the following.

~bv[]
 (defconst *x* (cons 1 2))
 (defconst *y* (cons 1 2))
~ev[]

In Common Lisp, ~ilc[cons] is guaranteed to provide a new pair that is distinct
from any previously created pair, so we know that *x* and *y* will be distinct
objects and we will be able to tell them apart from one another using ~c[eq].
But this difference is not visible in the ACL2 logic, and no ACL2 function can
tell *x* apart from *y*.

The normed-ness of an object is a similarly invisible property.  In Common
Lisp, invisible to ACL2, we maintain a data structure called a \"Hons Space\"
that records which objects are normed.  So, being normed is not an intrinsic
property of an object, but instead is determined by whether the object is
mentioned in this Hons Space.


Notes about Garbage Collection.

The Hons Space includes tables with pointers to every normed cons and
string.  One consequence of this is that normed objects cannot be reclaimed by
Lisp's ordinary garbage collector, even after they have become unreachable from
the perspective of an ACL2 program.

For CCL users only, ~ilc[hons-wash] is a special kind of garbage collection
that allows normed conses to be reclaimed.  For other Lisps, the only option is
to occasionally, manually clear out these Hons Space tables with
~ilc[hons-clear].")

~c[(hons-copy x)] returns a ~il[normed] object that is equal to X.~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

In the logic, ~c[hons-copy] is just the identity function; we leave it enabled
and would think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.

Under the hood, ~c[hons-copy] does whatever is necessary to produce a
~il[normed] version of X.~/

What might this involve?

If X is a symbol, character, or number, then it is already normed and nothing
is done.

If X is a string, we check if any normed version of X already exists.  If so,
we return the already-normed version; otherwise, we install X as the normed
version for all strings that are ~ilc[equal] to X.

If X is a cons, we must determine if there is a normed version of X, or
recursively construct and install one.  Norming large cons trees can become
expensive, but there are a couple of cheap cases.  In particular, if X is
already normed, or if large subtrees of X are already normed, then not much
needs to be done.  The slowest case is norming some large ACL2 cons structure
that has no subtrees which are already normed.

Note that running ~c[hons-copy] on an object that was created with ~ilc[cons]
is often slower than just using ~ilc[hons] directly when constructing the
object.~/"

Under the hood, ~c[hons] does whatever is necessary to ensure that its result
is ~il[normed].~/

What might this involve?

Since the car and cdr of any normed cons must be normed, we need to
~ilc[hons-copy] x and y.  This requires little work if x and y are already
normed, but can be expensive if x or y contain large, un-normed cons
structures.

After that, we need to check whether any normed cons equal to ~c[(x . y)]
already exists.  If so, we return it; otherwise, we need to construct a new
cons for ~c[(x . y)] and install it as the normed version of ~c[(x . y)].

Generally speaking, these extra operations make ~c[hons] much slower than
~c[cons], even when given normed arguments."

In the logic, ~c[hons-equal] is just ~ilc[equal]; we leave it enabled and would

Under the hood, when ~c[hons-equal] encounters two arguments that are both
normed, it becomes a mere ~ilc[eql] check, and hence avoids the overhead of
recursively checking large cons structures for equality.~/

Note.  If ~c[hons-equal] is given arguments that do not contain many normed
objects, it can actually be much slower than ~ilc[equal]!  This is because it
checks to see whether its arguments are normed at each recursive step, and so
you are repeatedly paying the price of such checks.  Also ~pl[hons-equal-lite],
which only checks at the top level whether its arguments are normed."

~c[(hons-equal-lite x y)] is a non-recursive equality check that optimizes if
its arguments are ~il[normed].~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2

In the logic, ~c[hons-equal-lite] is just ~ilc[equal]; we leave it enabled and

Under the hood, ~c[hons-equal-lite] checks whether its arguments are normed,

calls ~ilc[equal] to determine if its arguments are equal.~/

The idea here is to strike a useful balance between ~c[equal] and
~ilc[hons-equal].  If both arguments happen to be normed, we get to use a very
fast equality comparison.  Otherwise, we just get out of the way and let
~c[equal] do its work, without the extra overhead of recursively checking
whether the subtrees of x and y are normed."

Logically, ~c[hons-clear] just returns nil; we leave it enabled and would think
it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.

Under the hood, ~c[hons-clear] brutally (1) clears all the tables that govern
which conses are ~il[normed], then (2) optionally garbage collects, per the
~c[gc] argument, then finally (3) re-norms the keys of ~ilc[fast-alists] and
persistently normed conses; ~pl[hons-copy-persistent].~/

Note.  The hash tables making up the Hons Space retain their sizes after being
cleared.  If you want to shrink them, see ~ilc[hons-resize].

Note.  CCL users might prefer ~ilc[hons-wash], which is relatively efficient
and allows for the garbage collection of normed conses without impacting their
normed status.

Note.  It is not recommended to interrupt this function.  Doing so may cause
persistently normed conses and fast alist keys to become un-normed, which might
lead to less efficient re-norming and/or violations of the fast-alist
discipline."

objects (CCL Only).~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

Logically, ~c[hons-wash] just returns nil; we leave it enabled and would think
it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.

Under the hood, in CCL, ~c[hons-wash] runs a garbage collection after taking
special measures to allow normed conses to be collected.  In Lisps other than
CCL, ~c[hons-wash] does nothing.  This is because the efficient implementation
of ~c[hons-wash] is specific to the \"static honsing\" scheme which requires
CCL-specific features.~/

Why is this function needed?  Ordinarily, it is not possible to garbage collect
any normed conses.  This is because the Hons Space includes pointers to any
normed conses, and hence Lisp's garbage collector thinks these objects are
live.  To correct for this, ~c[hons-wash] (1) clears out these pointers, (2)
runs a garbage collection, then (3) re-norms any previously-normed conses which
have survived the garbage collection.

Note.  It is not recommended to interrupt this function.  Doing so may cause
persistently normed conses and fast alist keys to become un-normed, which might
lead to less efficient re-norming and/or violations of the fast-alist

Logically, ~c[hons-resize] just returns nil; we leave it enabled and would
think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.

Under the hood, ~c[hons-resize] can be used to change the sizes of certain hash
tables in the Hons Space.

All arguments are optional.  The size given to each argument should either be
nil (the default) or a natural number.  A natural number indicates the newly
desired size for the hash table, whereas nil means \"don't resize this table.\"
Any non-natural argument is regarded as nil.~/

You may wish to call this function for two reasons.

1.  Improving Performance by Resizing Up

Since the hash tables in the Hons Space automatically grow as new objects are
normed, ~c[hons-resize] is unnecessary.  But automatic growth can be slow
because it is incremental: a particular hash table might be grown dozens of
times over the course of your application.  Using ~c[hons-resize] to pick a
more appropriate initial size may help to reduce this overhead.

2.  Reducing Memory Usage by Resizing Down

Resizing can also be used to shrink the hash tables.  This might possibly be
useful immediately after a ~ilc[hons-clear] to free up memory taken by the hash
tables themselves.  (Of course, the tables will grow again as you create new
normed objects.)

Advice for using ~c[hons-resize].

Note that hash tables that are already close to the desired size, or which have
too many elements to fit into the desired size, will not actually be resized.
This makes resizing relatively \"safe.\"

Note that the ~ilc[hons-summary] function can be used to see how large and how
full your hash tables are.  This may be useful in deciding what sizes you want
to give to ~c[hons-resize].

Note that ~c[hons-resize] operates by (1) allocating new hash tables, then (2)
copying everything from the old hash table into the new table.  Because of
this, for best performance you should ideally call it when the hash tables
involved are minimally populated, i.e., at the start of your application, or
soon after a ~ilc[hons-clear]."

  ":Doc-Section Hons-and-Memoization

notes about ~il[HONS], especially pertaining to expensive resizing operations~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

Certain ``Hons-Notes'' are printed to the terminal to report
implementation-level information about the management of ~il[HONS] structures.
Some of these may be low-level and of interest mainly to system developers.
But below we discuss what users can learn from a particular hons-note,
``ADDR-LIMIT reached''.  In short: If you are seeing a lot of such hons-notes,
then you may be using a lot of memory.  (Maybe you can reduce that memory; for
certain BDD operations, for example (as defined in community books
~c[books/centaur/ubdds/]), variable ordering can make a big difference.)~/

By way of background:

~bq[]
The ADDR-HT is the main hash table that lets us look up ~il[normed] conses,
i.e., ~il[hons]es.  It is an ordinary Common Lisp hash table, so when it starts
to get too full the Lisp will grow it.  It can get really big.  (It has been
seen to take more than 10 GB of memory just for the hash table's array, not to
mention the actual conses!)

Hons-Notes may be printed when the ADDR-HT is getting really full.  This growth
can be expensive and can lead to memory problems.  Think about what it takes to
resize a hash table:

  (1) allocate a new, bigger array~nl[]
  (2) rehash elements, copying them into the new array~nl[]
  (3) free the old array

Until you reach step (3) and a garbage collection takes place, you have to have
enough memory to have both the old and new arrays allocated.  If the old array
was 10 GB and we want to allocate a new one that's 15 GB, this can get pretty
bad.  Also, rehashing the elements is expensive time-wise when there are lots
of elements.

Since resizing a hash table is expensive, we want to avoid it.  There's a
~ilc[hons-resize] command for this.  You may want your books to start with
something like the following.

~bv[]
  (value-triple (set-max-mem (* 30 (expt 2 30))))      ; 30 GB heap
  (value-triple (hons-resize :addr-ht #u_100_000_000)) ; 100M honses
~ev[]

Basically, if you roughly know how many honses your book will need, you can
just get them up front and then never to resize.~eq[]

The Hons-Notes about ``ADDR-LIMIT reached'' are basically there to warn you
that the ADDR-HT is being resized.  This can help you realize that your
~ilc[hons-resize] command had too small of an ADDR-HT size, or might suggest
that your book should have a ~ilc[hons-resize] command.  There are also
commands like ~c[(]~ilc[hons-summary]~c[)] and, defined in community book
~c[books/centaur/misc/memory-mgmt-logic.lisp], ~c[(hons-analyze-memory nil)].
These can show you how many honses you currently have, how much space they are
taking, and that sort of thing.  (A nice trick is to call ~ilc[hons-summary] at
the end of a book, to get an idea of how many honses you should ask for in your
~ilc[hons-resize] command).

alists with hidden hash tables for faster execution~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

The implementation of fast alists is, in many ways, similar to that of ACL2
arrays.  Logically, ~ilc[hons-acons] is just like ~c[acons], and
~ilc[hons-get] is similar to ~ilc[assoc-equal].  But under the hood, hash
tables are associated with these alists, and, when a certain ~st[discipline] is
followed, these functions execute with hash table speeds.

What is this discipline?  Each ~c[hons-acons] operation \"steals\" the hash
table associated with the alist that is being extended.  Because of this, one
must be very conscious of which object is the most recent extension of an alist
and use that extension exclusively.

The only penalty for a failure to keep track of the most recent extension is
a loss of execution speed, not of correctness, and perhaps the annoyance of
some ~ilc[slow-alist-warning]s.

Maintaining discipline may require careful passing of a fast alist up and down
through function calls, as with any single threaded object in an applicative
setting, but there is ~st[no syntactic enforcement] that insists you only use
the most recent extension of an alist as there is for single threaded
objects (~ilc[stobj]s).  Also, even with perfectly proper code, discipline can
sometimes be lost due to user interrupts and aborts.~/

Performance Notes

~l[hons-acons] for how the final ~ilc[cdr] of a fast alist can be used as a
size hint or as a name for reports printed by calling ~ilc[fast-alist-summary].

The keys of fast alists are always ~il[normed].  Why?  In Common Lisp,
equal-based hashing is relatively slow, so to allow the use of eql-based hash
tables, ~ilc[hons-acons] and ~ilc[hons-get] always ~ilc[hons-copy] the keys
involved.

Since alist keys are frequently atoms, this norming activity may often be so
fast that you do not need to think about it.  But if you are going to use large
structures as the keys for your fast alist, this overhead can be significant,
and you may want to ensure that your keys are normed ahead of time.

There is ~b[no automatic mechanism] for reclaiming the hash tables that are
associated with alists.  Because of this, to avoid memory leaks, you should
call ~ilc[fast-alist-free] to remove the hash table associated with alists
that will no longer be used.")

Logically, ~c[hons-get] is just an alias for ~ilc[hons-assoc-equal]; we

discipline warnings that might arise from execution during theorem proving.

Under the hood, when ~c[alist] is a fast alist that is associated with a valid
hash table, ~c[hons-get] first norms ~c[key] using ~ilc[hons-copy], then
becomes a ~c[gethash] operation on the hidden hash table.~/~/"

~c[(hons-acons key val alist)] is the main way to create or extend
~il[fast-alists].~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

Logically, ~c[hons-acons] is like ~ilc[acons] except that its guard does not
require ~ilc[alistp]; we leave it enabled and would think it odd to ever prove
a theorem about it.

Under the hood, two things are done differently.  First, the key is copied with
~ilc[hons-copy]; this lets us use EQL-based hash tables instead of
EQUAL-based hash tables for better performance.  Second, assuming there is a
valid hash table associated with this alist, we destructively update the hash
table by binding key to val.  The hash table will no longer be associated with
alist, but will instead be associated with the new alist returned by
~c[hons-acons].~/

Hash Table Creation

A new hash table is created by ~c[hons-acons] whenever alist is an atom.
Unlike ordinary ~c[acons], we do not require that alist be nil, and in fact you
may wish to use a non-nil value for one of two reasons.

1.  As a size hint

By default, the new hash table will be given a quite modest default capacity of
60 elements.  As more elements are added, the table may need to be resized to
accommodate them, and this resizing has some runtime cost.

When a natural number is used as a fast alist's name, we interpret it as a size
hint.  For example, ~c[(hons-acons 'foo 'bar 1000)] instructs us to use 1000 as
the initial size for this hash table and binds 'foo to 'bar.  The resulting
table should not need to be resized until more than 1000 elements are added.
We ignore size hints that request fewer than 60 elements.

Because of hash collisions, hash tables typically need to have a larger size
than the actual number of elements they contain.  The hash tables for fast
alists are told to grow when they reach 70% full.  So, an easy rule of thumb
might be: multiply the expected number of elements you need by 1.5 to keep your
hash tables about 2/3 full.

2.  As an alist name

We also frequently use a symbol for alist, and think of this symbol as the name
of the new alist.  We have found that naming alists can be valuable for two
reasons:

First, the name can be helpful in identifying fast alists that should have been
freed, see ~ilc[fast-alist-summary].

Second, names can sometimes be used to avoid a subtle and insidious
table-stealing phenomenon that occurs when using fast-alists that are
themselves normed; see ~ilc[hons-acons!].

At the moment, there is no way to simultaneously name a fast alist and also
give it a size hint.  We may eventually allow strings to include embedded name
and size components, but for now we have not implemented this capability."

(defn hons-acons! (key val alist)
  ":Doc-Section Hons-and-Memoization

~c[(hons-acons! key val alist)] is an alternative to ~ilc[hons-acons] that
produces ~il[normed], fast alists.~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].

Logically, ~c[hons-acons!] is like ~ilc[acons] except that its guard does not
require ~ilc[alistp]; we leave it enabled and would think it odd to ever prove
a theorem about it.

Ordinarily, ~il[fast-alists] are constructed with ~ilc[hons-acons] instead of
~c[hons-acons!].  In such alists, the keys are honsed, but the conses that make
up the \"spine\" of the alist itself are ordinary conses.  In other words, it
is basically correct to say:

~bv[]
 (hons-acons key val alist) == (cons (cons (hons-copy key) val) alist)
~ev[]

In contrast, when ~c[hons-acons!] is used, the conses making up the alist
itself are also normed.  That is,

~bv[]
 (hons-acons! key val alist) == (hons (hons key val) alist)
~ev[]~/

Generally, you ~st[should not use] ~c[hons-acons!] unless you really know what
you're doing.

Drawback 1.  ~c[hons-acons!] requires you to ~ilc[hons-copy] all of the values
that are being stored in the fast alist.  If you are storing large values, this
may be expensive.

Drawback 2.  It can be more difficult to maintain the proper discipline when
using ~c[hons-acons!].  For instance, consider the following:

~bv[]
  (let ((al1 (hons-acons 1 'one (hons-acons 2 'two nil)))
        (al2 (hons-acons 1 'one (hons-acons 2 'two nil))))
     ...)
~ev[]

Here, both al1 and al2 are valid fast alists and they can be extended
independently without any trouble.  But if these alists had instead been
constructed with ~c[hons-acons!], then since both al1 and al2 are equal, normed
conses, they will literally be ~ilc[eq] and hence will refer to precisely the
same hash table.  In other words, ~c[hons-acons!] makes it relatively easy to
~st[inadvertently] steal the hash table associated with some other fast alist.
This problem can be alleviated somewhat by uniquely naming alists; see the
discussion in ~ilc[hons-acons] for details.

Despite these drawbacks, ~c[hons-acons!] is the only way besides
~ilc[hons-shrink-alist!] to generate a fast alist that is normed.  It is not
adequate to ~ilc[hons-copy] a fast alist that was generated by ordinary
~ilc[hons-acons] calls, because this would produce an EQUAL-but-not-EQ object,
and this new object would not be associated with the fast alist's hash table."

~c[(make-fast-alist alist)] creates a fast-alist from the input alist,
returning ~c[alist] itself or, in some cases, a new object equal to it.~/

Note: it is often better to use ~c[with-fast-alist]; ~pl[with-fast-alist].

Logically, ~c[make-fast-alist] is the identity function.

Under the hood, we construct and return an object that is ~c[equal] to
~c[alist] and which is a fast alist.  If ~c[alist] is already a fast alist,
almost no work is required: we simply return it unchanged.

When ~c[alist] is not fast, we must minimally construct a hash table for its
bindings.  It is often possible to bind this new hash table to ~c[alist]
itself.  But in certain cases when the alist keys are not ~il[normed], a new
alist must be constructed, also, and so we may return an ~c[equal] but not
~c[eq] alist.  (In these cases, we still try to avoid at least some consing by
reusing the \"longest normed tail\" of the alist.)~/~/"

(defn hons-shrink-alist (alist ans)
  ":Doc-Section Hons-and-Memoization

~c[(hons-shrink-alist alist ans)] can be used to eliminate \"shadowed pairs\"
from an alist or to copy ~il[fast-alists].~/

This ~il[documentation] topic relates to the experimental extension of ACL2
supporting hash cons, fast alists, and memoization; ~pl[hons-and-memoization].
It assumes familiarity with fast alists; ~pl[fast-alists].

Logically, ~c[(hons-shrink-alist alist ans)] is defined as follows:

~bv[]
 (cond ((atom alist)
        ans)
       ((atom (car alist))
        (hons-shrink-alist (cdr alist) ans))
       ((hons-assoc-equal (car (car alist)) ans)
        (hons-shrink-alist (cdr alist) ans))
       (t
        (hons-shrink-alist (cdr alist) (cons (car alist) ans))))
~ev[]

The alist argument need not be a fast alist.

Typically ans is set to nil or some other atom.  In this case, shrinking
produces a new, fast alist which is like alist except that (1) any
\"malformed,\" atomic entries have been removed, (2) all \"shadowed pairs\"
have been removed, and (3) incidentally, the surviving elements have been
reversed.  This can be useful as a way to clean up any unnecessary bindings in
alist, or as a way to obtain a \"deep copy\" of a fast alist that can extended
independently from the original while maintaining discipline.

Note that hons-shrink-alist is potentially expensive, for the following two
reasons.
~bq[]

o The alist is copied, dropping any shadowed pairs.  This process will require
a hash table lookup for each entry in the alist; and it will require creating a
new alist, which uses additional memory.

o Unless ans is a fast alist that is stolen (see below), a new hash table is
created, which uses additional memory.  This hash table is populated in time
that is linear in the number of unique keys in the alist.
~eq[]

When ans is not an atom, good discipline requires that it is a fast alist.  In
this case, ~c[hons-shrink-alist] steals the hash table for ans and extends it
with all of the bindings in alist that are not in ans.  From the perspective of
~ilc[hons-assoc-equal], you can think of the resulting alist as being basically
similar to ~c[(append ans alist)], but in a different order.

Note that when ans is not a fast alist (e.g., ans is an atom) then such
stealing does not take place.

A common idiom is to replace an alist by the result of shrinking it, in which
case it is best to free the input alist, for example as follows.
~bv[]
  (let ((alist (fast-alist-free-on-exit alist
                                        (hons-shrink-alist alist nil))))

~c[(with-fast-alist name form)] causes ~c[name] to be a fast alist for the
execution of ~c[form].~/

Logically, ~c[with-fast-alist] just returns ~c[form].

Under the hood, we cause ~c[alist] to become a fast alist before executing
~c[form].  If doing so caused us to introduce a new hash table, the hash table
is automatically freed after ~c[form] completes.

More accurately, under the hood ~c[(with-fast-alist name form)] essentially
expands to something like:

~bv[]
 (if (already-fast-alist-p name)
     form
   (let ((<temp> (make-fast-alist name)))
     (prog1 form
            (fast-alist-free <temp>))))
~ev[]

Practically speaking, ~c[with-fast-alist] is frequently a better choice then
just using ~ilc[make-fast-alist], and is particularly useful for writing
functions that can take either fast or slow alists as arguments.  That is,
consider the difference between:

~bv[]
 (defun bad (alist ...)
   (let* ((fast-alist (make-fast-alist alist))
          (answer     (expensive-computation fast-alist ...)))
    (prog2$ (fast-alist-free fast-alist)
            answer)))

 (defun good (alist ...)
    (with-fast-alist alist
      (expensive-computation alist ...)))
~ev[]

Either approach is fine if the caller provides a slow ~c[alist].  But if the
input ~c[alist] is already fast, ~c[bad] will (perhaps unexpectedly) free it!
On the other hand, ~c[good] is able to take advantage of an already-fast
argument and will not cause it to be inadvertently freed.

See also the macro ~c[with-fast-alists] defined in the community book
~c[\"books/centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp\"], which allows you to call
~ilc[with-fast-alist] on several alists simultaneously.

The community book ~c[\"books/centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp\"] extends the
~c[b*] macro (defined in the community book ~c[\"books/tools/bstar.lisp\"])
with the ~c[with-fast] pattern binder.  That is, after executing
~c[(include-book \"centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp\" :dir :system)] you may write
something like this:

~bv[]
 (b* (...
      ((with-fast a b c ...))
      ...)
   ...)
~ev[]

which causes ~c[a], ~c[b], and ~c[c] to become fast alists until the completion
of the ~c[b*] form.

Note that ~c[with-fast-alist] will cause logically tail-recursive functions not
to execute tail-recursively if its cleanup phase happens after the
tail-recursive call returns.~/~/")

(defdoc with-stolen-alist
  ":Doc-Section Hons-and-Memoization

~c[(with-stolen-alist name form)] ensures that ~c[name] is a fast alist at the
start of the execution of ~c[form].  At the end of execution, it ensures that

~c[name] was not a fast alist originally, its hash table link is freed, and if
it was a fast alist originally but its table was modified during the execution
of ~c[form], that table is restored.  Note that any extended table created from
the original fast alist during ~c[form] must be manually freed.~/

Logically, ~c[with-stolen-alist] just returns ~c[form].
